  <h3>Fall</h3>
  <p>Fall has always been my favorite season for many reasons. For starters, it is the start of the NFL season which is by far my favorite sport to watch. It is also usually the perfect weather here in Missouri, not too hot and not too cold. It's a great time of year to be outside by a bonfire, do some camping, or go on a bike ride. There is also a lot of hype and excitement surrounding the holidays such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.</p>

  <h3>Summer</h3>
    <p>Summer is the second best season in my opinion. I always like to plan float trips, swimming parties, and lake trips with friends and family. It's a great time of year to be by the water and relax with those closest to you. My wife is a teacher so we get to spend quality time together over the summer. I'm a big sports fan as well, and it's when the Cardinals have a majority of their games so that's a plus too.</p>

  <h3>Spring</h3>
    <p>Spring is a great time of year as well. The positives are that the weather is starting to get warmer, and you can feel the promise of summer in the air. There are also usually a lot of events going on with people eager to get back outside. The reason it doesn't rank higher on my list is because it usually rains a lot, and also it can be 70 degrees one day, then 30 degrees the next. This can be quite depressing!</p>

  <h3>Winter</h3>
    <p>Let's be honest, the only good thing about winter is the holidays and watching football. Yes, I would hate to live somewhere that's hot all the time, but the cold becomes way too miserable after awhile. January and February are easily the most depressing months of the year. After the Super Bowl, it would be great if we could jump right into May. </p>
